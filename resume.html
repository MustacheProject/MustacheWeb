 This allow the company to save money, reduce the impact on the environment, make the work faster and the information easy to retrieve.</li>
<li>I handled a whole massive shipment ( around 300 recipients ) of special books that happen every couple of year.
 There were usually 40/45 % of the shipment fail, delays and high budget requirement. I decrease the average to 5%, minimise the delays and reduce
  the budget of 30/35 %. Everything without put any delay on the schedule.</li>
