	<h1>Presentation </h1>
	<p align="justify">
	Currently students at AIPE school for the VET Software Development course, I'm an Italian guy actually living in Sydney.<br>
	<br>
	When someone look at my resume immediately think that I'm an insecure guy that doesn't know what to do in his life and  I can easily
	understand why :<br><br>
	- High school degree in computer science<br>
	- Got a cook school and work as chef for almost four years<br>
	- Come in Sydney to study Software Development<br>
	- Knowledge in Photography, Video Making and post production<br>
	<br>Sounds really messy, isn't it?<br><br>
	But it's not like that, I'm not insicure and the reason why I change so radically my job and keep studying a lot of different thing
	is cause I wanted to gain as much experience as I can and see a lot of different reality.<br>
	If you are searching for someone who have deeply knowledge in something specifically, I'm sorry I've wasted your time, but if you are looking for someone 
	able to learn a lot of different skills and capable to adapt to difficult situation, you should give me a chance.
